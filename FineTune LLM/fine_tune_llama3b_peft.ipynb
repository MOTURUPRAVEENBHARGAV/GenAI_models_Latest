       "  'A few nights ago, my husband and I were watching an episode of Dragon\\'s Den, the Canadian version of Shark Tank, and a \"social good\" company was pitching their Haitian recycling program. It was a bad business concept poorly executed, but it didn\\'t justify one of the Dragons\\' responses, paraphrased below:\\nYou\\'re going about this the wrong way! You don\\'t create a social good business before you become profitable. You become profitable by whatever means necessary, and then you give back! That\\'s how business works.\\nNow, I\\'ll concede that there\\'s something to the idea that a business needs to be successful in order for a positive end to be achieved. But her response is not an unusual one in the business community, and more often than not, the American Sharks who invest in social enterprises also buy this \"the ends justifies the means\" argument. Put another way, business people as a rule - and no thanks to Capitalism - prioritize profit over social good. If some money can be thrown at a few noble causes at the end of the line, that\\'s great. But do what you have to do to thrive, even if that means exploitation.\\nIn an apparent attempt to combat that mindset, there are now hundreds of startup brands on the \"ethical\" market that use buzzwords like social enterprise, one-for-one, and give-back to describe themselves. One would presume by the marketing that being charitable makes a company ethical, and I\\'ve seen many ethical bloggers and influencers tout these brands as such, even when there\\'s very little data on their supply chain. But it begs the question: can a company really be ethical if workers are not provided a living wage, if they\\'re not working in a safe environment, and if no attention is paid to the sustainability of raw materials?\\nWhile give-back brands market themselves around the social good, how much good are they actually achieving? And is it enough?\\nCharitable small businesses believe that they are doing something different by placing a cause front and center in their marketing. But, on a practical level, if their supply chain isn\\'t in order, they may not be doing much more than a conventional business. They may be even worse.\\nAfter all, those big, nasty corporations their marketing subtly critiques do the same thing.\\nLarge corporations have a history of giving back. GE matches employees\\' charitable giving, Johnson & Johnson recently pledged 1 million dollars towards improving air quality around the world, and, since 2006, the BP Foundation has donated more than 218 million dollars to community initiatives around the country. Even Walmart, through its Foundation, awards grants and scholarships, and donates money in $200,000 lump sums to all sorts of relief efforts and deserving programs.\\nBeing charitable is not a new angle. You could probably make the case that it\\'s actually an engrained component of American enterprise, as fundamental as having a business plan. Americans really love charitable giving. In fact, in 2015 alone individual citizens and American businesses gave $373.25 billion dollars to charity.\\nYou can look at this from a couple of perspectives. On the one hand, it\\'s really nice to know that these hugely profitable enterprises are designating at least some of their profits to charitable giving. It\\'s certainly better than nothing, and for the recipients of these pledges, scholarships, and funds, it can be life changing.\\nBut it also makes it awfully convenient for these companies to never address problems in their supply chain - or even company culture within corporate offices - because as long as they claim they\\'re being responsible, they can practically get away with murder (but, more realistically, with gross negligence when it comes to their most vulnerable workers).\\nSo, when a nicely branded \"social enterprise\" tells me they give back, I have questions.\\nWhere are your raw materials sourced? Who makes your product? Where? What\\'s the wage? Have you visited your supplier? How did you choose your supplier, and why?\\nIf they can\\'t answer these questions with relative ease, something\\'s wrong.\\nIt\\'s not that charity is bad. Charity is very good, and comes from good human emotions like empathy, love, and maybe a bit of guilt. Charity is what\\'s needed in times of crisis - in famine, tsunami, and war.\\nBut charity is also a bandaid placed on broken systems.\\nCharities, by their nature, go where there is trouble. Uprising, corruption, colonialism, exploitation, bigotry, terror. No amount of external aid, even if given in love and good faith, can correct underlying systemic issues. Sometimes, charity makes things worse.\\nThe documentary, Poverty Inc., explores the ways in which charity has become big business, delaying permanent infrastructure and job development. In Haiti, NGOs are often so poorly managed that money simply vanishes, given to inefficient subcontractors or wasted on lavish homes.\\nAfter an earthquake devastated Haiti in 2010, Americans donated tens of millions of dollars to relief efforts. Haitian communities were inundated with donated rice, forcing local rice farmers to compete with free product, running many of them out of business. Meanwhile, an onslaught of solar panel donations threatened local alternative energy businesses. Even if individuals were helped in the short term, the local economy was now dependent on foreign aid to keep it afloat. Not only is this unsustainable, it\\'s unethical.\\nChange happens when marginalized communities are empowered to transform systems of oppression into systems of flourishing.\\nSocial good brands must realize that there are limits to charity, and that building a charitable business model without attention to the ethics of their supply chain or the long term efficacy of the nonprofits they support is both irresponsible and dangerous.\\nThe best possible world is one in which charity no longer needs to exist because people are able to provide for their families and their communities. It is a place where individuals are valued and not exploited. Where the root causes of injustice are addressed before they can spiral out of control.\\nCharity is only good now because it is necessary. But the world we should be working toward is one where people are far too important to ever be turned into charity cases, where we don\\'t get to feel good about giving.\\nWhere we get to claim that we\\'re good only when we know that everyone is being treated as the sacred beings they are.\\nIn the words of John Wesley:\\nDo all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can.\\nSo, businesses, by all means give to charity. But take it a step further by seriously scrutinizing your supply chain for the slightest sign of injustice and exploitation. Care about company culture. Care about the environment. Vet the charities you support. Treat others the way you\\'d like to be treated.\\nI originally covered this topic on my post on One-for-Ones. I\\'m hoping to do another post distinguishing between charity as a virtue versus \"charity, inc.\" soon.',\n",
       "  'Game Notes EDM vs BUF\\nBuffalo Sabres (Head Coach: Dan Bylsma) at Edmonton Oilers (Head Coach: Todd McLellan)\\nNHL Game #31, Rogers Place, 2016-10-16 05:00:00PM (GMT -0600)\\nSabres 6-2\\nReferees: Tim Peel, Brad Watson\\nLinesmen: Ryan Gibbons, Devin Berg\\nThree Stars: Ryan O’Reilly; Brian Gionta; Leon Draisaitl\\n- OK, look, I know we’re all disgusted at a big loss to a badly injured bottom feeder like Buffalo. But it’s important not to get overly caught up in the post facto narrative your brain is going to create as it looks through the lens of that putrid score.\\n- The truth is that the Oilers had a sh*t ton of great chances, and whiffed on a bunch of them. And the few they didn’t whiff on were mostly stopped.\\n- The Sabres on the other hand had fewer and less dangerous chances, but seemingly scored on all of them (and by my count, scored on three that weren’t really chances at all!)\\n- Make no mistake, these were two world-class tire fires going at it, and the Oilers have a lot to clean up, just as they did after the Flames victories. But the Sabres were by far the larger and stinkier of the two tire fires. Rewatch the game if you don’t believe me (I’m doing that right now to confirm my post game comments, and yes, it hurts a lot).\\n- The truth is, we see this kind of thing regularly – goaltending extremes will pretty much always override whatever happens with the rest of the team. What I mean by that is that great goaltending will overcome a huge deficit in play, and bad goaltending will torch a big advantage in play. And the latter is what happened tonight.\\n- What’s that old saying? “Goaltending is 50% of the game – unless you don’t have it, in which case it’s 100%”. Yup.\\n- On a side note, the reffing was horrific, as it always is when Tim Peel is soiling the ice with his presence. But that’s not why the Oilers lost.\\nGame at a Glance\\nLeaderboard\\n- Milan Lucic, Benoit Pouliot each had 1 goal\\n- Leon Draisaitl blasted 6 shots on goal\\n- Leon Draisaitl was most active on the team with 8 shot attempts\\n- Leon Draisaitl was the faceoff champ at 70.0% (7-3)\\n- Patrick Maroon, Jesse Puljujarvi drove shot attempts most with on-ice 5v5 CF% of 75.0\\n- Anton Lander trailed the team in 5v5 on-ice shot attempts at 50.0% (4-4)\\n- Milan Lucic was the big hitter with\\n(click image to embiggen)\\nForward Lines – Shots Taken\\n(click image to embiggen)\\nPlayer/Pair/Line – Head to Head – CF, DFF, TOI\\n(click any image to embiggen)\\nNHL Media Highlights\\nClick the link to play the associated highlight video\\nOkposo’s first goal with Sabres\\nLucic’s first goal as an Oiler\\nGionta’s tip-in goal\\nLehner’s point-blank save\\nGionta’s second goal of game\\nPouliot buries the rebound\\nO’Reilly’s power-play goal\\nTalbot’s great glove save\\nLehner’s strong kick save\\nO’Reilly’s goal from center ice\\nMoulson’s top-shelf goal\\nAdvertisements\\n4 thoughts on “G3 2016-10-16 Ermagerd, wournded Burffalo r darngerous!”\\nIn the third at 5 on 3 the point shot bounds off the boards and goes to six of net where Talbot pad stops it. This about the 6:50 mark.\\nPretty sure that puck goes in. Even worse for Talbots night.\\nI wonder, are you able to get that clip? Talbots glove hides where the puck is and he slips it out.\\nHmm, interesting. Let me take a look, I think I have a way to capture it as a clip if so\\nYeah, I think I see what you mean around 7:00 left. it’s certainly possible it might have been over the line, but as you say, it looks like Talbot’s glove is covering it so can’t be called anyway. Of course, officials have disallowed an Oiler goal where it was visibly over the line and not covered, so I wouldn’t put it past them to call a covered puck a goal against!'],\n",
